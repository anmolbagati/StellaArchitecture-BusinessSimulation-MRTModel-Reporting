# StellaArchitecture-BusinessSimulation-Reporting
Report simulates the starting of an organisation based on the scenario and the DSS plays out that scenario to see feasability of the current company dynamics.

Use Stella Architect to build a model that will support decision-making regarding the creation of the Elite Insurance Company-Case Study (EIC).
Prepared system documentation for my model that will allow another DSS analyst to understand your model to the extent that they can modify and maintain it.
