# StellaArchitecture-BusinessSimulation-Reporting

Brief Overview:
-Analysing, designing and developing a DSS to support a strategic decision task;
-Documenting the details and dynamics of the DSS;
-Presenting the DSS to decision makers in ways they can understand; and
-Manipulation of the DSS to accommodate the decision makerâ€™s changing requirements.

Report simulates the starting of an organisation based on the scenario and the DSS plays out that scenario to see feasability of the current company dynamics.

Use Stella Architect to build a model that will support decision-making regarding the creation of the Elite Insurance Company-Case Study (EIC).
Prepared system documentation for my model that will allow another DSS analyst to understand your model to the extent that they can modify and maintain it.
